You only look once (YOLO) which is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system.

On a Pascal Titan X, it processes images at 30 FPS and has a map of 54.48% on COCO test-dev.

By default, YOLO only displays objects detected with a confidence of .35 or higher.

You can change this by passing the -thresh flag to the yolocommand.
